      <h3>07 Jan 2016<br>Yamaha HTR-5740 AV Receiver</h3>
      <img src="assets/blog-images/IMG_5155.jpg">
      <p><h4>Visual Design:</h4>
        This receiver will not be winning any product design awards, in my opinion.
        The text is set in all caps, and the size of the text is miniscule even for my young eyes.
        I would expect my father to be grumbling while he unearths a pair of strong reading glasses just
        so he can figure out which button he is pushing. Perhaps the text labels would be more effective if
        set in a different typeface (maybe Helvetica Neue or something else that works well at small sizes)
        in lower or title case. I don't mind the black buttons, but I would personally have designed a bit
        more contrast into the "power" button. The "power" button is black, like all the other buttons,
        and has the same "feel" when pressed as all the other buttons. I would have made the power button a different
        color, and incorporated some other indication that it's different from the other buttons.

      <p><h4>Appeal:</h4>
        This receiver is not sexy. Perhaps it is sexy to an electronic music guru or someone who spends time steeped
        in the recording arts. For the average person who wants an average receiver, this interface, at first glance,
        appears intimidating and technical because of the ambiguously labeled controls (it's almost like the interface
        expects the user to be an expert) and the lack of readily available instruction "in the world". The receiver
        almost looks somber because of how black it is.</p><br>
      <p><h4>Effectiveness:</h4>
          Not very. Figuring out what each control is used for requires a careful study of the receiver's manual, instead
          of simply looking at the control labels. For example, one button is ambiguously labeled "A/B/C/D/E". Like many
          amps and receivers, the modes, meant to simplify the control of multiple devices, in fact complicate operations
          more than necessary. To use this receiver properly is simply too time consuming. I've had the receiver for five
          years, and I still turn it to "DVD" mode to play a vinyl record.</p>
